# Crime Point Pattern Analysis - Washington D.C.

This project employs various point pattern analysis techniques to investigate the spatial distribution of crimes in Washington, D.C. Additionally, 
a simple multilayer perceptron was trained to investigate which sociodemographic factors have the greatest impact on whether spatial units are identified as crime hotspots, using SHAP values.
  
The point pattern analysis techniques employed include Average Nearest Neighbor Analysis, Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis (Ripleyâ€™s K-function), and Getis-Ord Gi Hotspot Analysis. 
The multilayer perceptron was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using standard Python data science libraries.
